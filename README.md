# Banking Customer Churn

This is a basic machine learning project built using Jupyter Notebook, including basic libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, where I implemented and compared two classification algorithms — Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier — on a given dataset
•	This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
•	The classification goal is to predict whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes or no).
